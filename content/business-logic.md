# Approaching Development Obstacles with a Business Mindset

## The Issue

Anyone who works heavily in cybersecurity as a hacker or penetration-tester will tell you that the most important skill to learn is the mindset of a hacker.  From a personal experience, that has absolutely proven itself to be true, as looking at a problem from a different perspective can help allow you to make better business decisions overall.

What I find incredibly lacking when it comes to development, is the mindset of a business owner.

## Hear Me Out

First of all, I have the advantage of having been through business school <em>before</em> I decided to pursue tech as a career.  Admittedly, the goal from the offset was to learn the skills needed to run an online business myself, and taking that approach lead me to a much different path than I see most take in this field.

Many of us developers truly love the process.  Building things through code can be fun, and even though it may not all be rosy, there is something unique about being able to architect elegant solutions through programming.  This feeling seems to lead many astray when it comes to real-world applications.

Tech is constantly evolving to solve problems, and sometimes to solve the problems it's created itself.  The sheer amount of options and tooling available to developers to solve any given task is truly overwhelming.  There is always something new to learn, and many times the community will fully commit to something before they truly understand it (I'm looking at you, AI)

When you look at the state of code as a business manager, there are often many factors to consider when making informed business descisions, and while the flexibility that the access to these tools provides is as much as a benefit as it is a detriment.  The stack you choose today may not be the best practice solution tomorrow, leading to expensive rewrites, extensive employee training, and above all else, costs.

## Hidden Costs

Nothing stated so far is very ground-breaking and is apparent to anyone who works in the field.  There are a few key concepts that those with a formal education in business will recognize that seem to be misunderstood by those without.

Most often developers have no concept of the time value of money.  The time value of money essentially states that sometimes the time that it takes you to deploy a product is worth spending extra money to speed up.  Imagine, if you will, a business manager deciding whether or not to hire an extra employee, a common scenario.  Typically, hiring an extra employee is seen as a cost burden, and immediately discouraged as the right solution to a problem.  Often they will try to do more with less, squeezing their employees to complete more tasks using less resources, all in order to save a typically negligible amount.

In business school, you learn that many times, you can offest your costs and more simply by being able to be first to market.  This especially rings true with Marketing, as the sooner you begin to market your product, the better the results will be overall.  More specifically though, when it comes to developers, there is a lack of understanding of what is the most important factor in running any business application.

The best example is probably the choice of programming language.  Python is widely adopted as being easy to read, and is very friendly to collaborative projects, making it very easy to prototype solutions and release products.  It is also one of the slowest languages in terms of processing speed, largely due to being an interpreted language, but nevertheless it is not very efficient.  Here, you are trading raw performance for development speed, and when considering the time value of money, it is no wonder why more and more businesses are choosing python over others to meet their business needs.

If you were to talk to the development community, however, most of the true techies would highlight the poor performance, and will recommend any number of languages instead.  In addition, at times pure performance is necessary to provide a good user interface, or to save processing overhead.  In this case, python would not be a good choice at all, but this dilemma leads me to the next point:

Opportunity cost is another common mistakes I see developers make quite frequently.  Opportunity cost is the <em>true</em> cost of a decision when comparing it to the alternatives.  Simply put, when faced with multiple descisions, at times the most obvious solution is actually not the most ideal when considering all circumstances.

As I write this article, tech is currently in a hiring recession.  Across the board, businesses are choosing to layoff large groups of staff in order to save their bottom line, however in certain circumstances this will be a mistake for multiple reasons, not the least of which will be opportunity cost.

By choosing to layoff staff, many of these companies have chosen to sacrifice growth in exchange for profit margins.  Under most scenarios in an unsaturated market (a market with room to grow), this is a fatal mistake.  History is riddled with companies that refused to choose growth, and the opportunity cost of that decision was the entire business model.  Myspace at one time was the worlds top social media platform.  AOL was one of the largest internet providers.  Blockbuster was the defacto name in entertainment.  Each one of these companies chose not to innovate and keep up with competitors for the sake of profit margin, and every one of these names is a shell of the company it was before.

Large tech companies are not immune from the same thing happening to them.

## Too Big to Fail?

The harsh reality is, most tech businesses are actually terribly run businesses, but between quasi-monopolies, barriers to entry, and a flood of investment dollars, that hasn't seemed to matter much.

Scores of companies are not even breaking even, let alone profitable, but are propped up due to a misguided belief that the business model is too good, but as we are seeing today in this changing environment, you can only run an unprofitable business for so long until things start to go belly up.  Can Google afford to lose half of it's search engine share if a viable competitor came around?  Facebook would be in a drastically different place today had they not purchased the much more successful Instagram.  Each day, the time value of money and opportunity costs present itself each day, and is an ever present reminder of making the wrong decision by failing to account for every factor.  The money is rarely the bottom line when it comes to business growth, and only becomes the main factor upon reaching market saturation.

The truth is, what we are witnessing is for many of these companies, a fatal flaw that will reward those choosing the opportunity cost of staff layoffs with the loss of large business sectors.  Microsoft ignored mobile gaming years ago when it was an obvious market leader, but they missed that opporunity and now products like the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck have taken that market as a result.  An Xbox Phone had the potential to rival the iPhone for years to come, and now it is an afterthought for most of the public, choosing the Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy instead.

Perhaps the most thoughtless move made during this tech recession is the layoff of security staff.  Not only is this irresponsible at best for many reasons, the time value of money and opportunity cost in the event of an attack is a true choice.  Companies like Sony, MGM, Ceasars, and others choose to risk their entire business instead of investing a much smaller amount in providing adequate security measures.  The reality is that we have not yet seen the true consqeuences of these decisions yet, but they will become more and more prevalent as time goes on.

## Market Viability

The purpose here is to help inform others in order to make better business decisions, and not scold those for making mistakes.  The reality is, mistakes can easily cost the entire business if not careful.  Companies like Yahoo!, Blackberry, or Atari have been reduced to almost nothing due to poor business decisions, but the flip side of this equations are that there are plenty of opportunities for those willing to challenge the status quo and make a bold move.  Indeed, this is quite common when you talk to developers working towards a start-up of their own, which leads me to the last potential pitfall I see engineers make, and seemingly the most.

If you build it they will come is actually very untrue.  Plenty of products have been launched after years of effort and vast amount of money to no market.  Even worse, many developers can focus incredibly hard on an idea that was doomed to fail from the start.  Time and time again products are released that will never make more than a handful of sales, if anything at all.

What is the solution to this problem?  Fail fast and often.  There is a reason that as you hang around in tech, amid all the choices you can make, repeatedly the best one is the one that allows you to get product to market the fastest.  Use python, focus on an MVP, harness no-code, as developers we seem to forget that most times this is the most important decision.  The faster you can release products, the quicker you will get feedback to decide whether you really should invest more time in the idea.  Most times under this scenario it is much easier then to revisit and enhance an already successful product than trying to overengineer the perfect solution to a problem that no one has.

The quicker you can determine market viability, the quicker you can determine if it is worth the time value to spend on an idea, avoiding the opportunity cost of wasting time on an idea that isn't realistic instead of an idea that potentially would be successful.

## Conclusion

Whether you are a current manager, business owner, or startup, the takeaways here should help you make better business decisions by challenging the status quo.  At times the answer that seems the most obvious is actually a mistake that could have been avoided by approaching the problem from a business perspective.
