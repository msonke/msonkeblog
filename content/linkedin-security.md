# Why I can't take you Seriously as a Security Professional if you have a LinkedIn

## Let me cook...

Social Media has been a large societal point of evolution.  Over the past decade, Social Media has shaped the way we consume content, formulate opinions, get news, stay in contact, market ourselves, and even date.  It's hard to think of more influential technology when it comes to the everyday lives of individuals everywhere.  It has become so pervasive now, that it is actually seen as not normal to refuse to take part in the community.  It's hard to think of a better example of this than LinkedIn.

Used in professions anywhere, but particularly in tech, LinkedIn has become the defacto hub for anyone looking to make professional connections.  The benefits of LinkedIn as a networking and marketing tool are hard to overlook, as it has become a common place not only for people to seek employment, but also post content and showcase their work, regardless of the intention.  Over the years, LinkedIn has become a crutch for people trying to make a name for themselves, and truly benefits the industry as a whole.

However, LinkedIn is one of the biggest security liabilities of the modern era.

## Story-time

I have been heavily involved with computer security ever since the days of Limewire.  Years ago I would alter windows registry keys and constantly and fixed virus/trojan/worms using a dial-up modem and the limited information available through AskJeeves and eventually Google, and as such there have been quite a few evolutions in both the complexity and severity of cyber-attacks.  What seemingly remains a constant is the threat of social engineering.

Indeed, I can attest due to the many concerts, events, and clubs that I have managed to socially engineer my way into, simply by convincing someone that I was supposed to be somewhere.  Social engineering is one of the easiest ways to hack, and as long as human-error exists, it will always be an entry-point for any potential hackers.

One of the first true cybersecurity books I read was written by the late Kevin Mitnick, a famous if not the most famous hacker.  The book itself was written as a guide on how to stay anonymous (although in the book he essentially states that it's virtually impossible), and he did this through telling various stories of his encounters as a hacker.

Mitnick himself is a somewhat controversial figure in the cybersecurity world, and while his technical skills and prowress are undeniable, Social Engineering seemed to be arguably his biggest strength.  Within the book he explains an instance where after being cut off by a driver, he managed to extract revenge by calling the DMV simply using the man's Licence Plate Number, convincing the agent to reveal the man's phone number, and proceeding to then give him a call to share what I'm sure were simply a few pointers on how to drive correctly.

What was the most interesting to me, was a story where he proceeded to explain that during one Social Engineering attack, he wanted to see all the employees of a certain company in order to find a target, and lo-and-behold a quick visit to LinkedIn gave him all the information he needed to complete the attack and more.  Upon reading this passage, it is obvious how much of a liability this essential networking tool truly is.

## The Problem

Naturally, one can see the issues with having all of your personally identifiable information in one place.  Information you would never consider sharing, including entire work history is on display for the world to see.  Not only is this detrimental to companies as outlined before, but it is incredibly harmful to individuals.  Identity fraud is incredibly easy to inact simply by visiting a completed LinkedIn profile.  It has become a one-stop shop for hackers to gain all the information they need.

Not long ago, I had a discussion with a fellow colleague of mine, wondering why I didn't have a LinkedIn profile of my own, especially while starting to network in the tech field.  I am sure at the time, it was most likely considered odd, even with the risks outlined above, given all the potential benefits it could bring to my career.  The longer you are in the field of cybersecurity, you realize it truly is a zero-sum game, where you are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, and LinkedIn is a gaping hole in the current cybersecurity field.

In fact, recently it was revealed that the high-profile hack of MGM Resorts over 2023, was executed using... you guessed it... LinkedIn.  The attackers simply used the information publically accessible to impersonate an employee in order to gain credentials, leading to the severe crippling of MGM's operations at the tune of millions of dollars a day, much more than the cost of employing an adequate security team.  While there are multiple points of failure in this scenario, time and time again it is revealed that LinkedIn was the core of a cybersecurity attack.

## Script-Kiddies vs Professionals

The title is both click-baity and true at the same time.  I witness scores of cybersecurity "professionals" preach the importance of MFA, encryption, IAM, and secure storage of PII, turn around and announce to the world everything a hacker would want to know in a very public manner in LinkedIn.  Multitudes of employees of large firms like Mandiant and Splunk proudly reveal an organizational map that details most every employee in most any department you could want.  The Open-Source Intelligence(OSInt) that can be gathered from this site is truly staggering, and is a glaring security hole.

I can understand if you don't work in cybersecurity and post a profile.  Most people don't have the hacker's mentality and aren't aware of the security risks that it presents.

If you work in cybersecurity and have a LinkedIn, it's another story entirely.  How do you expect to be taken as a cybersecurity expert while simultaneously being willing to reveal most of the information you are trying to protect in a public setting?  Social Media itself is a valid attack vector, as it can also reveal much more personal information about an individual.  Most of a typical social media profile doesn't have the information that LinkedIn contains, which is why it is an <em>eggregious</em> mistake for anyone who is serious about cybersecurity to make.

I cannot stress enough how truly counter-intuitive this is.  If the goal is to present yourself as a professional on LinkedIn, you have just proven that you are not.  If you can be this careless about the fundamentals of cybersecurity, what <em>other</em> seemingly obvious preventative measures are you willingly neglecting?  Password reuse?  Lack of MFA?  Encryption?  At best you display your ignorance, while at worse you are openly inviting malicious actors to attack, the exact opposite of the cybersecurity ethos.

## What now?

The tone has been purposely harsh, and for good reason.  How many more LinkedIn attacks need to happen before we address the issue?  Clearly there are other ways to get this information, and not all information shared on LinkedIn is particularly harmful.  In fact, rest assured that simply having a LinkedIn isn't the problem, but the type of information shared on it.  In order to rectify this situation, there are a few steps you can take to minimize the attack surface but still enjoy the benefits that LinkedIn provides.

First, consider if you need it at all.  LinkedIn would like you to use their site as any other social media, and encourages sharing content and details in order to form connections.  I believe that you can easily still share content and network, as long as you are <em>very</em>conscious about the information you are choosing to share.

If you aren't actively looking for a job, consider at the least removing your work history.  Many times the information gathered from a history of employment is enough to execute a social engineering attack, so remove that as a possibility.  Next, consider retracting the name of the company, and instead outline the roles and tasks performed only.  Non-disclosure agreements(NDAs) exist, and most times its enough to see the role and skills an individual provides rather than the specifics of the workplace.  Obviously it can be advantageous to reveal the company name if they carry some prestige in the industry, and if you choose to reveal it, understand the risks that is poses and be very deliberate with where you are posting it.

If you currently have a job and are not looking for a job, I would recommend not revealing your current workplace details if possible. One can still network and market themselves without also opening themselves and the company they work for to a cyberattack.  At the end of the day, the goal is to be conscious of the threats that exist and attempt to mitigate the attack surface you provide to potential threats.

Last, if you are a cybersecurity professional, consider deleting LinkedIn.  Individuals that work in the industry of cybersecurity have a reason to be targeted more than other fields, and it requires an extra sense of vigilance in order to properly incorporate a truly secure lifestyle.  Long passwords, encryption, and MFA are necessary tools to combat and mitigate damage from any attacks, and being aware of the pervasive threat of Social Media is just as important in this zero-sum game.

## Conclusion

The goal of this post was most assuredly not to repremand anyone who has a LinkedIn, far from it.  The point is simply that every individual needs to be more cautious about the details they choose to share with the world.  Even though the intentions can be pure and fundamental, such as the desire to network and self-promote, the consequences of being ignorant of the potential threat of oversharing can far outweigh the potential benefits.
