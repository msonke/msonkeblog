# The Number One Reason you need to add Figma to your Workflow

## Disclaimer

I am absolutely not paid by Figma to endorse their product, and even though I prefer Figma, there are other alternatives that can do similar tasks, albeit not in the same easy-to-use way that Figma does it.

## The Need for Figma

At my core, I am a developer.  I tend to gravitate towards trying to complete a proof of concept in code as quickly as possible.  For the longest time, I assumed that the best approach was to outline the problem I was trying to solve in an imperative approach, and dive into providing a solution by starting in my code editor of choice.  Tools like Tailwind CSS, Hugo, Next.js, etc. all make the development process and iterating over ideas a breeze, and adding a layer of abstraction can easily seem counter-intuitive.

You seem, myself and what I assume many other developers feel is that eventually, it will all be code.  Spoiler alert, there is no magic to Figma or any other design tool that can convert a design into accurate code.  There are a few plugins that can help simplify the process, but at the end of the day any design work that's completed will need to be fleshed out with code sooner or later.  Therefore, it seemed like the quickest way to provide a workable product is to simply skip the design process entirely and dive straight into the codebase.

This is absolutely the wrong approach, and it wasn't until I started using tools like AdobeXD and Figma that I truly understood the power that these programs bring to a workflow.

## Objective Development Speed

When working with a team, it is often the case that design work is split off from the development team, and clearly it makes sense to do so.  In any business organization, it will be more productive to take the linux approach where each individual part does their task extremely well, in lieu of a more generalized approach.  However, it is also seen as many that outsourcing the design process is an unnecessary cost, especially considering the aforementioned point that it will all be translated to code in the first place.  Why do you need a designer, and why can't you simply let the developers design through code?  Afterall, this seemingly eliminates a step, as well as the potential for any communication errors between designer and developer.  When the developer is also the designer, there should be no discrepancies between what the design intends and what the developer codes, they are all from the same source.

Obviously when a designer is part of the team, this can speed up the workflow when it comes to large projects since it allows developers to focus on what they do best, but it becomes unclear as to if eliminating the design position can lead to the same speed.  Technically speaking, the a front-end developer is the chokepoint, and removing a layer of communication could potentially lead to a faster deployment time.  For the longest time, I assumed that this was a viable solution, and that by starting with coding first, you might save a significant amount simply by eliminating the excess overhead that proper design can sometimes bring.

This is a valid line of reasoning, but it ignores the largest benefit I have found that starting with design brings to my workflow.

## Cognitive Load

Personally, the cognitive load that is spared simply by starting with a great and well-thought out design is game-changing.

Web Design is a process that is easy to grasp at it's surface, but incredibly deep to master.  Effective designers will deliberately choose elements and styling to make attractive user interfaces that take the end-user into consideration, and provides for a good user experience for any potential clients.  This is actually the key to why design should be a part of any developer's toolkit.

You see, by engineering a solution at a high-level, you are able to offload most of the cognitive load that is placed on the coding process to the start of the project.  Having a great design from the starts means you have made most of the crucial app descisions before you lay your first line of code, which saves countless hours down the road both in rewrites and potential bug fixes.

The elegance of this solution is magnified when you begin to consider other use-cases for design, such as templating a logic workflow, brainstorming, and gathering ideas into a centralized location.  Very quickly a developer will see how much easier it is to use a tool like Figma to whiteboard a project first, then using those descisions during the coding process.  UML (Unified Markup Language) diagrams are incredibly worthwhile when you are able to separate your core app logic from your syntax and conditional logic.

In essence, offloading the logic in this manner is where incorporating design into a workflow truly shines.  It is much easier to follow a guideline of classes, interactions, state, and storage when it is outlined in a template.  The coding process flows much quickly, as there is no real need for context switching, a notorious productivity killer.

In addition, making design decisions while quickly iterating in Figma is <em>much</em> faster than starting with code first.  Even though it's not always hard to change the code if the design needs to be altered, it takes longer to revisit code and make constant changes than it does to make those same changes in Figma.  This offloads the task of design to truly focus on the design first and ensure that the end product will be visually appealing before committing anything to code.

Naturally, this leads to fast feedback, and when combined with the collaborative features that most modern day design tolls provide, you can easily allow the visual composition of the app to take center stage, and will leave you with a better product overall.  Indeed, when combined in tandem separating the design and coding processes is a logical step.

## Adoption

The evidence of the benefits of adding a initial design step have become apparent throughtout the industry, and can be seen on display in many areas of tech.  Whiteboarding is a somewhat common practice, and a crucial tool when working in large teams.  Tools like AWS Step Functions have this concept at it's core, allowing you to design your logic flows in a simplified manner, minimizing the time it takes to fully develop any application as well as the amount of potential bugs present by addressing issues earlier in the process.

I have found that the more you can offload your core logic into a high-level view first before coding, the easier the coding process will become, and reduces the amount of desicion making you have to do in order to simply implement the designs you've already created.  The cognitive load that is spared while coding is refreshing, and easily makes the process both more comfortable and fast.

## Conclusion

I felt the need to share my findings with anyone who could potentially benefit from them.  Before I learned to use Figma, I had assumed that just starting to code was the best approach, as that was what I was comfortable with and could focus on my strengths.  Although this was a decent approach, the decision to start my projects in Figma and design applications before opening an editor made for a <em>drastically</em> better workflow, and allows me to release higher quality products faster.

Even something as trivial as naming variables can save time and headaches if done in the design process instead of while coding.  I can easily recommend that anyone who is willing to take the leap and add design to their process will immediately feel the benefits, and will enhance your workflow to the next level.
