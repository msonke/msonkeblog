# Why being a Generalist pays off over the long run over a Specialist

## Jack of all Trades...

When people mention the phrase, "Jack of All Trades, Master of None," they don't tend to finish the phrase...

"But Better Still than a Master of One."

Indeed, no more is this true than the world of tech.  There can be cases made for both sides, and under certain circumstances being a Specialist makes more sense than being a Generalist, it's simply reality.

Large companies tend to have incredibly specialized workforces, and are notorious for employing whole teams to manage seemingly trivial tasks.  It was rumored companies like Amazon would devote an entire team to a simple design decision such as a button.  While the legitimacy of these claims remain, the benefits of being a Specialist in a large corporation can be very beneficial.  For example, if you needed to hire a front-end developer, it may not make sense to require them to know other tasks like networking, security, or even back-end code.

In these scenarios, the Specialist tends to shine, but it's not always as clear-cut of a benefit as it seems.  There is also the concept of pigeon-holeing, which is essentially being a victim to that same specialty skill, and having a hard time branching out into other fields if needed, since often in depth-knowledge does not translate well to other areas.

Being a highly specialized COBOL developer would be a great benefit to a personal career, until the time that COBOL falls out of favor.  In that scenario, and many others I'll outline, it's much better to be a continual learner with depth, only specializing when it's needed.

## Skill Overlap

Based on personal experience, one of the largest benefits to having a broad range of skills are when skillsets overlap.  You can easily develop a modern app without knowing anything about networking, and the lack of networking knowledge in the age of no-code tools may not be necessary at all, even as it is a core foundation to the product.  Yet, if you do have a knowledge of networking, you will most likely be able to do much more than the basics, and most likely will be able to create a better product than if you did not.

Tech overall has many skills that overlap and intersect, no better example of that is the concept of DevSecOps.  Each of these fields is interrelated.  You can easily specialize in any one, but any individual that understands all three is much more valuable.  Maybe the best example of this is security, where fundamental knowledge can prevent critical mistakes from being make while constructing core infrastructure.  Without said knowledge, developers are largely unaware of even the simplest of attack vectors, and can lead to expensive downtime and fixes.

The advantages don't stop there, and it has repeatedly proven itself true that the better understanding of the whole system involved in an application's design, the better decisions will be made at the foundational level, leading to enhanced benefits and features that are largely unavailable to someone who is ignorant of the potential solutions that having a wide knowledge pool.

Yes, every time a new skill is learned there is time overhead invested as well as a feeling of discomfort until enough practice is completed.  Most times this initial time investment will pay dividends from that moment on, however, as new techs and frameworks can often make the development process quicker and easier.  It is absolutely worthwhile to spend that time, even if it may seem like a waste initially.

## Examples

Let's return to the poor COBOL developer mentioned above.  While initially their skills related to COBOL may not be beneficial directly, the chances are high that many of the concepts and even some of the best practices <em>will</em> transfer, and indeed would be an asset even if the task doesn't involve writing COBOL at all.  In that sense, this is why most experienced developers will dabble in a few different programming languages.  The skills involved in programming tend to build on each other over time, and you find that your experience writing a problem in another programming language may lead you to apply some of the same concepts used in another way to solve a different problem.

DevSecOps is a common buzzword that highlights the overlap of tech skills.  While a developer can still be great without knowing technologies like Terraform or Docker, they are so much greater by adding these new skills to their repertoire.  Even the recent AI revolution has introduced the field to new skills that when used correctly can greatly enhance a developer's speed, and results in a faster time to market.

In as short as a few months, those that decided to embrace AI tech and incorporate it into their workflow early have experienced the benefits of that skill and in turn are much more marketable that those who didn't.  Yet another case where it pays dividends over the long term to have a wide depth of skills.

## When is it enough?

Ultimately, it's easy to get lost with the amount of options available when it comes to skills one can learn.  Seemingly there is always something to learn, and while that is true, there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel, especially for those who are just starting their journey and tech.  It's hard to know whether or not something will truly be a waste of time, and it's something that I'm sure anyone who has spent time on a technology that they never used or was deprecated by something else.

The key is to focus on only the tech you are interested in, that are necessary to complete the job, <em>when it's necessary to complete the job.</em>  What I mean by this, is that perhaps it doesn't make sense to learn in depth Kubernetes and K8s if you have no intention of running a cluster of servers any time soon.  Maybe you don't need to learn that extra framework if the one you use is adequate.  It might be possible that all you are really looking for is a site that can be provided by a no-code solution and you really don't need to learn another stack.  If you aren't having performance issues, it's not all that pressing that you learn Rust.

That's not to say there won't be benefits to doing any of these, and the potential is high that in your process of learning something seemingly unrelated that you will take away a concept that you can apply to your current project.  However if you focus entirely on the next new thing, the knowledge you have will be wide, but not very deep, and you will also need to review anything you learned before when you finally do need to use it.  It would have been much better focusing on building the app to the point where it needed to scale out, then at that time learning the technologies needed to deploy what you're looking to accomplish.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, more than likely it is better to keep expanding personal understanding of tech.  At times, something you learn while working on something unrelated will cause you to rethink about the approach you take when applying new skills to existing knowledge.  This breadth of skills will continue to pay dividends regardless of how tech chooses to evolve in the future.
